**Japanese Zen Typing**

<img width="512" height="512" alt="koto-koto_banner" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/80f81de5-e797-4387-8cee-efc4ef408129" />

## Overview

**Koto-Koto** is a minimalist, zen-inspired Japanese typing game designed to induce a state of flow. Unlike frantic arcade typing games, Koto-Koto focuses on rhythm, aesthetics, and the beauty of the Japanese language.

Built with **Next.js 16**, **TypeScript**, and **Framer Motion**, it features a custom-built, feature-rich typing engine that handles the nuances of Romaji-to-Kana conversion (e.g., `si` vs `shi`, `n` flexibility).

## ✨ Features

-   **Dynamic Seasonal Atmosphere** (花鳥風月 - Kacho-Fugetsu): Real-time visual themes based on Japan's 4 seasons with seasonal particle animations (🌸💧🍂❄️).
-   **Time-of-Day System** (移ろい - Utsuroi): Visual atmosphere changes throughout the day (Morning/Day/Sunset/Night) with brightness and saturation adjustments.
-   **Zen Aesthetics**: A Deep Zen Dark theme with dynamic color adjustment based on time. Use of Mincho typography for a literary feel.
-   **Intelligent Typing Engine**:
    -   **Flexible Romaji**: Supports multiple input styles (Hepburn, Kunrei-shiki). Accepts `si`/`shi`, `tu`/`tsu`, `c`/`k`, etc.
    -   **N-Permisiveness**: gracefully handles the tricky `n` vs `nn` logic.
-   **Realistic Keyboard Sounds**:
    -   **13 Mechanical Switch Profiles**: Choose from authentic keyboard sounds including Cherry MX (Black, Blue, Brown), Topre, Holy Panda, Gateron (Alpaca, Black Ink, Red Ink), Cream, Alps (Blue Alps, Box Navy), Buckling Spring, and Turquoise.
    -   **Sound Switcher UI**: Easy-to-use dropdown menu (bottom-left corner) to switch between different keyboard sound profiles.
    -   **Persistent Settings**: Your preferred sound profile is saved to localStorage and automatically restored.
    -   **Optimized Performance**: Pre-loaded audio buffers with Web Audio API for low-latency, realistic sound playback.
-   **Strict Grading System**:
    -   **Zen Titles**: Earn ranks from "Novice" to "Koto Master" and special S-Ranks.
    -   **Detailed Stats**: Tracks WPM, Accuracy, KPM, and Max Combo.
-   **Modern Tech Stack**: Fully responsive, strictly typed, and built for performance.

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

-   **Visuals**: High contrast text with glowing carets against a noisy, deep-dark background.
-   **Typography**: `Zen Old Mincho` for Japanese text, `Inter` for UI elements.
-   **Feedback**: Subtle ripples and camera shakes (optional) provide physical feedback without breaking focus.
